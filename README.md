# MonitorLedController
Simple rgb lightning with an Arduino Nano + WS2812 based LED strip for your monitor, and a C# daemon to control it

Setting up your Arduino
-------------------
This project depends on [FastLED](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED), a small library for controlling led strips with an Arduino. First install that in your arduino/libraries folder. After that open the file `Arduino\Arduino.ino` in this repo, edit the `NUM_LEDS` variable so that it corresponds with your led strip, you should also set the `LED_PIN` variables to the data pin you are using, then flash it to your Arduino.

Compiling the daemon
-------------------
Now that you have your Arduino set up and connected, open the device manager and check which COM port your Arduino is connected on, open this project in Visual Studio and set the `COM_DEVICE` variable to your COM port. You can now compile the program and run it.

What does it do?
-------------------
It will turn on and off your led strip when your pc monitor turns on/off for sleep mode. You can also manually control your led strip by using the command box, to enable your led strip simply type `led on` and to turn it off type `led off`. More automatic background features will be added shortly.
